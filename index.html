  <h1>The Basics</h1>
  <p>Howdy y'all, this is the organinzed group for people who want to go cliff diving/camping at colored rock. I am going to set the dates for August 27th and 28th. It would be BYOB and bring your own food and water.  Not knowing the group size there is no way I can accout for eveyone. In addition, have fun and be safe!</p>

<h2>QnA?</h2>
<h3>Kyle where are we staying?</h3>
<p>There are many places to stay, I am currently looking at the 'Munising Tourist Park'. It seemed the most appropriate for food, wifi, and fun! I was going to do some work and get a survey on where we should stay. Buttttt, I think that's alot of work and if push comes to shove, just google where you prefer and you can stay there you picky puta.</p>
